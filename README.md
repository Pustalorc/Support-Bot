# Support-Bot
A very badly designed bot that will answer questions automatically in discord.

Channels are forced to be:
* To answer questions: bot-support
* To decide/answer unanswered questions from the chat above: bot-decisions
* To analyze pastebins with logs and explain the errors: bot-pastebin-analyzer

If you want to put the bot in your server, download the code, compile it, and then host it yourself.
